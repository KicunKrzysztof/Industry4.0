# Project for Agent Systems (using JADE)

## Industry 4.0

### Requirements:
* Job scheduling → “based on Daimler-Chrysler”
* In a factory → groups of ultra modern machines (GoM)
  * Each GoM can do various groups of operations on “prefabricated piece of material”
  * Typically, one GoM is not enough to complete a workflow
    * Completing a product requires multiple GoMs used in a specific order
  * Different requests materialize in an order that cannot be a’priori predicted
  * Various requests may have different “priority levels”
  * Different machines within GoMs can experience problems that will force them out of service, or require them to be (graciously) taken out of service – for limited (not necessarily known in advance) time
* In Daimler-Chrysler case it was shown that placing an agent within each GoM, and adding management agents to the ecosystem, can result in productivity improvement
* Aim of the project is to develop an agent-based “simulator” that will allow modeling and studying such ecosystem
